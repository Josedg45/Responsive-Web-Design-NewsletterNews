# Newsletter Subscription Page

This project contains the code for a simple, responsive newsletter subscription page.

## Overview

The page allows users to subscribe to a newsletter by entering their email address. It consists of a form with a logo, description, input field, and a subscription button. The design is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## HTML Structure

The HTML code defines the layout and structure of the page:

- **Header Section**: Contains the newsletter logo and the main title "Join our newsletter".
- **Description**: A brief paragraph explaining the benefits of subscribing to the newsletter. The description also includes a line break after the exclamation mark (`!`).
- **Email Input Form**: Users can input their email address and click the "Subscribe now" button to submit the form.
- **Confidentiality Note**: A short paragraph assuring users that their email will remain private.

### HTML Elements Used

- `<div>`: Container elements to group content.
- `<img>`: Displays the newsletter logo.
- `<h1>`: Main title of the page.
- `<p>`: Paragraphs for the description and confidentiality note.
- `<input>`: Email input field for users to type their email.
- `<button>`: Button to submit the form.

## CSS Styling

The CSS file provides styling for the HTML elements to create a modern, clean, and responsive design.

### Key Styles

- **`body`**: Defines the font family, padding, margin, and layout using flexbox to center the content.
- **`.container`**: Used for centering the main content with padding.
- **`.newsletter-icon`**: Styles the logo image.
- **`.title`**: Styles the page title with larger font size and bold weight.
- **`.description`**: Styles the description text, including font size and color adjustments.
- **`.email-input-container`**: Styles the container for the email input field and subscribe button, adding padding, background color, box shadow, and rounded corners.
- **`.email-input`**: Styles the email input field with padding, font size, and no borders for a cleaner look.
- **`.subscribe-button`**: Styles the subscribe button with a background color, font size, padding, and rounded corners. It also includes a hover effect to change the background color when the user hovers over the button.
- **`.confidentiality-note`**: Styles the confidentiality message with smaller font size and a neutral color.

### Responsive Design

The design is fully responsive, adjusting the layout for different screen sizes. The email input and subscribe button expand to fit the container width.
